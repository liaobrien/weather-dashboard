## Usage

This page can be accessed and used on any standard web browser. The user first enters the name of the city they want to receive weather data from. After clicking "Search", the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index of the city are displayed at the top, and the forecast for the next 5 days are displayed below. A sidebar of all the user's past searches also accumulates, and the user can click on any of those buttons to re-render the weather for that city.

## Credits
